  <p>The most famous Hollywood Era is called <strong class="gold">Hollywood The Golden Age.</strong>
  This period I think it is the most magical and fascinating, the one that represents better the art of making movies. The Golden Age began by the 1930s and during that time some of the most famous and iconic movies came to life. Actors and actresses such as Cary Grant, William Holden,Humphrey Bogart,Audrey Hepburn,Marilyn Monroe and Vivien Leigh were part of some of the most iconic motion pictures of all time. They were icons themselves and they still are.That world had something magic,poetic  and elegant that was able to bring up the best part of that time. Watching one of those movies it seems you can actually feel and live that incredible atmosphere. All the real Hollywood Stars lived back then. Brilliant actors,actresses,producers,film makers and all people who worked behind the scenes made the Golden Age a reality and a great piece of history.</p>
